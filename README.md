# Lithpy

*Work in progress*

A LISP dialect initially built following [Build Your Own LISP](http://www.buildyourownlisp.com).

Depends on [mpc](https://github.com/orangeduck/mpc) for parser combinators.

## Build

Run `make setup` to download dependency.

Then run `make`. Lithpy will build to `dist/`.
