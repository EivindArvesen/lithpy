# Lithpy

*Work in progress*

A Lisp implemented in C, following the book "[Build Your Own LISP](http://www.buildyourownlisp.com)".

Depends on [mpc](https://github.com/orangeduck/mpc) for parser combinators.

## Build

Run `make setup` to download dependency.

Then run `make`. Lithpy will build to `dist/`.
